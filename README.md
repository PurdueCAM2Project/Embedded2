# Embedded Computer Vision 2
System is used to detect usage of googles in labs that require them. System is ran on Jetson Nano and uses a Rasspberry Pi camera to record footage in the lab. To ensure individual privacy is protected, system obfuscates faces after detection and classification.

#### Features
* Retinanet based SSD performs face detection
* CNN performs classification of detected faces to determine if PPE is being used
* Faces are encrypted using AES
* Image metadata is stored on a SQL database server and images are stored on a remote computer.
